each command ends with newline caracter: "\n" or carriage return "\r"
lines starting with % are ignored.
space and tab is optional and ignored.
each number has to be a signed integer.
buffered actions:
"Cf X123 Y123 Z123 S123": buffer waypoint with specified XYZ coordinates in mm at speed S mm/s, fine precision (used in sharp bends).
"Cr X123 Y123 Z123 S123": buffer waypoint with specified XYZ coordinates in mm at speed S mm/s, rough precision (used where it's important to maintain velocity rather than reaching a certain point, such as an arc made of multiple waypoints).
"P T123": pause for T ms.
"Gr1": activate/close gripper/tool
"Gr0": deactivate/open gripper/tool

non-buffered: 
	actions:
"Vc X123 Y123 Z123 T123": maintain cartesian velocity XYZ mm/s for time T ms.
"Vl A123 B123 C123 T123": maintain velocity ABC mm/s for time T ms along lines, positive value meaning retracting lines.
"E": emergency stop! clear buffered waypoints, turn off motors(rube will fall to the ground)
"S": stop what you are doing and maintain your current position
"C": continue parsing waypoints
"R": reset waypoints,
	calibration:
"Cal A123 B123 C123" : set length of each line to ABC
"Acc 123": set max acceleration
"Pp P123 I123 D123": set position controller parameters, scaled with 0.01 internally ( i.e. sending P492 will set P= 4.92)
"Pv P123 I123 D123": set velocity controller parameters, scaled with 0.01 internally ( i.e. sending P492 will set P= 4.92)
"Ff 123": set estimated friction force to 123N.
