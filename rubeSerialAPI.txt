% RUBE API
% each command should end with newline caracter: "\n" or carriage return "\r"
% lines starting with "%" are ignored.
% space and tab is optional and ignored.
% each number has to be an integer.
non-buffered: 
	actions:
		"help": show this API
		"status": request rube to send current status, including: * battery voltage, 
			  *xyz coordinates, *linelengths, *loopFrequency, *input-output-latency
		"E": emergency stop! clear buffered waypoints, turn off motors(rube will 
		     fall to the ground)
		"S": stop what you are doing and maintain your current position
		"C": continue parsing waypoints
		"R": reset waypoints
		"Vc X123 Y123 Z123 T123": maintain cartesian velocity XYZ mm/s for 
					  time T ms.
		"Vl A123 B123 C123 T123": maintain velocity ABC mm/s for time T ms 
					  along lines, positive value meaning retracting
					  lines.

	calibration:
		"Cal A123 B123 C123" : set length of each line to ABC
		"Acc 123": set max acceleration
		"Pp P123 I123 D123": set position controller parameters, scaled with 0.01 
				     internally ( i.e. sending P492 will set P= 4.92)
		"Pv P123 I123 D123": set velocity controller parameters, scaled with 0.01
				     internally ( i.e. sending P492 will set P= 4.92)
		"Ff 123": set estimated friction force to 123N.

buffered actions:
	"Cf X123 Y123 Z123 S123": buffer waypoint with specified XYZ coordinates in mm
				  at speed S mm/s, fine precision (used in sharp bends).
	"Cr X123 Y123 Z123 S123": buffer waypoint with specified XYZ coordinates in mm 
				  at speed S mm/s, rough precision (used where it's 
				  important to maintain velocity rather than reaching a
				  certain point, such as an arc made of multiple waypoints).
				  MUST BE FOLLOWED BY A Cf OR Cr COMMAND! if you make a series
				  of Cr commands, finish with a Cf command before using pause
				  or tools
	"P T123": pause for T ms.
	"Gr 1": activate/close gripper/tool
	"Gr 0": deactivate/open gripper/tool
	"Fan 1": start fan
	"Fan 0": stop fan
